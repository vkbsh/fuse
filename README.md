## Overview

The **Fuse Web Client** is designed as a **secure emergency UI** for managing your Fuse Wallet.
When the primary Fuse app is unavailable, this web interface ensures uninterrupted access to your vault, allowing you to **transfer SOL and tokens** safely.

- 🔒 Secure, multisig-protected
- 🖥️ Minimal & intuitive UI
- ⚡ Built on [Squads Protocol](https://github.com/Squads-Protocol)
- 🌍 Deploy anywhere (AWS, GCP, Vercel, Cloudflare, Netlify, Docker, etc.)

## How It Works

This web UI is designed for **emergency transfers** from a **Fuse wallet** (powered by [Squads Protocol](https://github.com/Squads-Protocol)).
The flow follows the default **threshold = 2** setup in Fuse.

---

### 1. Connect Wallet

- Log in with your Fuse-associated wallet (**Cloud key** or **Recovery key**).
- The **Cloud key** wallet is required to initiate transactions.

---

### 2. Select Token & Withdraw

- From the dashboard, choose the token (SOL or SPL token) you want to transfer.
- Create a withdrawal transaction.

---

### 3. Approvals (Threshold = 2)

- Transactions require **two approvals** in Fuse:
  1. **Cloud key** → Initiates the transaction
  2. **Recovery key** → Approves the transaction
  3. **Cloud key** → Executes the transaction

## Deployment

### Cloud Provider

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fvkbsh%2Ffuse%2Ftree%2Fmain)

### Docker

or you can use Docker:

```bash
docker build -t fuse .
```

```bash
docker run -p 80:80 fuse
```

## Testing

### Start a local validator

To run the tests, you need to have a local validator running. You can install the Solana CLI from the following [link](https://docs.solana.com/cli/install-solana-cli-tools).

Once you have the Solana CLI installed, you can start a local validator by running the following command:

```bash
npm run validator
```

### Run tests

```bash
npm run test:program
```
